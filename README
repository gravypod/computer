An example Virtual Machine
====

This is an example for writing a VM that I hacked together in an afternoon.

# compiler/assembler/main.c

Read assembly in from stdin and convert it into a string of ones and zeros.

# compiler/binwalker/main.c

Read a file made from the assembler via stdin and pack it into a binary file
named program.bin. 

# isa/main.c

Execute the program.bin file.
